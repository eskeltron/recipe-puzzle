## Steps to run

**Prerequisites**

- I choose MySQL as DB. If you wanna test locally in your computer please set your database's config in typeorm's config in src/config/typeorm.ts
- If you test locally, the ".env" file has "NODE_ENV=production" this indicate that use a remote database and you should not worry about that.

### 1.  Run `npm install`

### 2.  Open localhost:3000/graphql

### 3. Test!
