# Recipes

**Prerequisites**

- I choose MySQL as DB. If you wanna test locally in your computer please set your database's config in typeorm's config in src/config/typeorm.ts
- If you test locally, the ".env" file has "NODE_ENV=production" this indicates that it uses a remote database so you should not worry, just test it.

## Steps to run

### 1.  Run `npm install`

### 2.  Run `npm run dev` or `npm run start`

### 3.  Open localhost:3000/graphql

### 4. Test!
